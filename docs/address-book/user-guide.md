### What does the app do?

The Address Book is for maintaining a list of Ethereum addresses mapped to human-readable names, on-chain. The Address Book will enable a more user-friendly way to access and review common addresses a DAO uses for Allocations and Dot Voting.

<br>

### How do you use it?

Create a New Entity by specifying a name, Ethereum address and type (individual, organization, project)

Remove an entity by selecting the “Remove Entity” option in the context menu for the entry

<br>

### Custom Labels vs. Address Book

In Aragon’s 0.7 Bella release, a “custom labels” system has been released which allows a user to specify names for Ethereum addresses. This functionality is not to be confused with the Address Book. The custom labels system is a local system, meaning that the rest of the organization is not aware of what an individual has entered for a given entry.

<br>

### Future

An [API is under development for the Aragon platform](https://forum.aragon.org/t/identity-providers-resolving-addresses-to-identities-in-aragon/631) which will allow every app within Aragon that uses the <IdentityBadge> component for Ethereum addresses to render data from an external data source such as an app like the Address Book. Once this is released, Address Book entries can be useful outside the context of Allocations and Dot Voting.
We want to eventually provide support for search, sort, and the ability to maintain additional context around entities.
