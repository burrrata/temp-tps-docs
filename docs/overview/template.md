## Configure voting settings
The Dot Voting "quorum" requirement is the `minParticipationPct`, or minimum percentage of total votes required for a Dot Vote to succeed. This is different than the [Voting app's minimum acceptance quorum](https://wiki.aragon.org/dev/apps/voting/) which is the minimum % of all token supply that needs to vote "yes" in order for the vote to be succeed.
