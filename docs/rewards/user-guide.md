## What does the app do?

With Rewards, you can distribute payments to token holders based on the number of tokens one has earned in a specific cycle of time (one-time reward) or based on the total tokens one holds (dividend).
- One-time, or Merit Rewards, are determined based on how many tokens a token holder has earned compared to other holders, in a specific time period.
- Dividends are determined based on the percentage of token supply an address holds.

- To create a reward, select the “New Reward” action, which will open up a panel to specify details such as the reward type, amount, reference asset and cycle.
- Token holders that meet the condition of the reward (e.g. having a balance in a specific period) will be able to claim rewards in the “My Rewards” tab once the end date of the reward is reached (this is estimated based on an average block time of 15 seconds).
