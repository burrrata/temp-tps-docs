## What is dot voting?

[Dot voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting) is when voters can split thier vote into multiple pieces, then vote for multiple things. Imagine you have a pie. The pie is your vote. You can cut the pie up into different sized pieces and give them to the vandidates you support. This means that instead you giving a candidate all or none of the pie, you can support different votes with different levels of enthusiasm. This is useful to increase participation so people don't feel locked into any option they don't fully agree with.

### What does the Dot Voting app do?

Dot Voting is used to cast votes for Allocation or Issue Curation proposals. Members can vote on how to distribute an allocation across distinct entities or prioritize a list of Github issues by specifying a percentage of votes per option.

### How do you use it?

- The Dot Voting app is configured to a single token which ultimately determines who has the privilege to vote.
- Voting weight on a proposal is based on the token balance when the proposal was created.
- The Dot Voting is useful once a user has created an Allocation proposal or an Issue Curation proposal, as Dot Votes cannot be created from within the app (we did not include this feature since the Survey app serves that purpose).

## Future

- We plan on improving the slider interaction so itâ€™s less difficult to vote with your last couple dots, and to incorporate better math utilities to work out kinks with decimal precision.
- [We are thinking more about how the general user experience of Voting in the Aragon ecosystem can be improved.](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/issues/563#issuecomment-471332560) It may make more sense to eventually build toward a monolithic Voting app where users can vote in different ways, vs. three apps like Voting, Dot Voting, Surveys. Once multi-contract applications are possible within Aragon, it will be much cleaner to support such experiences.

## Where can I learn more?

The [Aurark website](https://www.autark.xyz/) is a great start.
- [Range Voting app](https://www.autark.xyz/range-voting) (note: range voting = dot voting)

[This blog post](https://medium.com/@stellarmagnet/that-planning-suite-live-on-rinkeby-c2332e2e5e27) also explains how to use the app in more detail.
